// ============================================================================
// Pure move, byte-for-byte: the PitchReport interface (was lib/types.ts) and
// PITCH_REPORTS data (was lib/mockData.ts) now live together in their own
// dedicated file, isolated from the ~15,200-line mockData.ts object literal.
// See DECISIONS-LOG.md for why: a prior attempt to extend this exact feature
// (adding international-venue pitch reports) corrupted mockData.ts badly
// enough to truncate ~13,800 lines and take down the whole app, twice,
// each requiring a hard reset to recover. Editing pitch-report data here
// can no longer touch match/ball/player data at all, structurally.
