## [1.0.15] 2026-07-02

### Home page — TABLE button + team schedule popup

#### Added — Dynamic TABLE button on live carousel (LiveCarousel.tsx)
- A **"[Comp] Table" pill button** appears below the live carousel only when the currently snapped card is a league or tournament match
- Button is fully dynamic: swipe to an IPL card → "IPL Table" appears; swipe to a Test/bilateral card → button disappears; swipe to PSL → "PSL Table" appears
- Carousel snap tracking rewritten to use `firstCard.getBoundingClientRect().width + 12px gap` (was using `el.clientWidth` which didn't account for the gap, causing index drift)

#### Added — Standings bottom sheet (LiveCarousel.tsx)
- Tapping the TABLE button opens a bottom sheet over the home page with full league standings
- Sheet includes a drag handle, competition name/subtitle, close (×) button
- Swipe-down gesture on the **handle/header only** dismisses the sheet; dragging >80px closes, less snaps back with spring transition
- Body scroll (`document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"`) locked while sheet is open, preventing background page from scrolling

#### Added — Team schedule popup (LiveCarousel.tsx, MiniStandings.tsx)
- Tapping any team row in the standings sheet opens a **second bottom sheet** showing that team's full tournament schedule — no page navigation
- Schedule sorted ascending (earliest match first)
- Past matches: Won/Lost badge in team colour + 10-word truncated summary
- Live match (if any): red left-border highlight + live status string
- Upcoming matches: date/time + venue city
- **Back button** (←) in the header returns to standings; close (×) closes everything
- `MiniStandings` gains optional `onTeamClick` prop — when provided uses `<button>` instead of `<Link>` so it works inside the popup context

#### Fixed — Sheet content scrolling (LiveCarousel.tsx)
- Added `min-h-0` to the scrollable content div — the canonical fix for `flex-1 + overflow-y-auto` not scrolling inside a flex column (content expanded to fit rather than scrolling)
- Removed `overflow-hidden` from the outer sheet container (was blocking inner scroll)
- Added `WebkitOverflowScrolling: "touch"` for iOS momentum scroll
- Touch gesture handlers moved exclusively to the header/handle zone — content area touch events no longer intercepted

---

## [1.0.14] 2026-07-02

### Test match — dual-innings score display

#### Added — Prior innings score on live Test match cards (MatchCard.tsx)
- When a Test match is in the **2nd innings or later**, the team's completed prior innings score appears **before** the current innings score: e.g. `199/10 & 88/4 (28)`
- Only triggers for `match.format === "Test"` and only when `innA.length >= 2` (team has played more than one innings)
- Shown in muted white/40 so it doesn't compete visually with the live innings score
- No change to T20/ODI display

---

## [1.0.13] 2026-07-02

### Critical bug fix — score sync and live status attribution

#### Fixed — LiveMatchCard score swap (MatchCard.tsx)
- **Root cause**: `innings[0]` was assumed to be teamA's innings and `innings[1]` teamB's. This is wrong when the visiting team bats first — their innings is `innings[0]` but they are `teamB`.
- **Fix**: Filter innings array by `battingTeam` field: `innA = innings.filter(i => i.battingTeam === teamA.code)`. Attribution is now correct regardless of toss outcome or batting order.
- Affects score display, batting indicator dot, and status text placement on live cards.

#### Fixed — liveStatusOf() status text swap (MatchCard.tsx)
- Same positional bug: function used `innings[0]` and `innings[1]` by array position to determine which team is chasing
- Rewritten to use `currentInn = innings[innings.length - 1]` and derive `battingTeam` / `fieldingTeam` from `currentInn.battingTeam`
- Status text (e.g. "ENG need 45 off 32 balls") now always names the correct team

---

## [1.0.12] 2026-07-02

### Cricket-first redesign — schedule, flags, lineup, popularity sort, win prob

#### Changed — Schedule page: competitions list with drill-down (app/schedule/page.tsx, app/schedule/[competitionId]/page.tsx)
- Schedule root now shows a **list of competitions** sorted by worldwide popularity — not individual matches
- Each row: coloured left bar, competition name, live badge (if any match is live), type + format pills, chevron
- Tapping a competition opens `/schedule/[competitionId]` showing all matches for that tournament
- Filter chips removed from schedule root (were noisy; competition grouping is cleaner)
- New server component `/schedule/[competitionId]/page.tsx` with `generateStaticParams`

#### Added — Team schedule page (app/schedule/[competitionId]/[teamCode]/page.tsx)
- Server component, pre-rendered for all `(competition, team)` pairs
- Three sections: Live Now, Upcoming, Results (reversed chronological)
- Past match rows show a Won/Lost colour bar indicator
- Linked from MiniStandings team rows (when using Link variant)

#### Added — Worldwide popularity sort for live + upcoming matches (app/page.tsx)
- Formula: `COMP_POP[comp.id] + TEAM_POP[teamA.code] + TEAM_POP[teamB.code]`
- `COMP_POP`: ICC T20 WC (100) → Ashes (90) → IPL (88) → bilateral series (68–80) → franchise leagues (40–66)
- `TEAM_POP`: IND (20), AUS (14), ENG (12), PAK (11), MI/CSK (10), RCB (9)…
- Applied to: live carousel, upcoming matches column, schedule competition list

#### Added — Country flags for national teams (MatchCard.tsx)
- `FlagOrRank` component replaces `RankPill` for national teams
- Uses `flagcdn.com/w40/{iso}.png` (40px wide) for crisp HiDPI rendering
- Flag ISO map covers 20 national teams; franchise teams still show `#rank` pill
- Switched from flag emoji (invisible on Windows) to PNG images

#### Changed — Playing XI: flat list, no subsections (LineupsCard.tsx)
- Removed "Batting Order" and "Bowlers Used" sub-headers
- Single `PlayerColumn` with `getXI()`: merges `battingCard + bowlingCard + squad`, deduped, max 11 players
- Header label: "Playing XI"
- Squad data (11 players) added to all 10 IPL teams in `mockData.ts`

#### Improved — Win probability chart (WinProbChart.tsx)
- Single smooth area chart with Catmull-Rom → cubic bezier smoothing, downsampled to ~60 points
- Team-coloured area fills under each line
- Clean header with team names + percentages; drag handle at top
- Back button (← chevron) top-left

#### Added — Win prob modal: back button + back-swipe gesture (MatchView.tsx)
- `← Back` button in WinProbChart header closes the modal
- `history.pushState({winProb:true})` on open; `popstate` listener fires `closeProbModal()` on browser back
- Mobile back-swipe gesture triggers close without needing the button

#### Added — Win prob modal: book page-turn animation (MatchView.tsx, globals.css)
- Opens with `book-enter-forward` (220 ms), closes with `book-exit-backward` (240 ms)
- `isClosingProb` state: animation plays before React unmounts the component

#### Fixed — Win% float precision (MatchView.tsx)
- `100 - 99.44` floating point error produced `0.5600000000000023%`
- Fix: `Math.round(pctA)` / `Math.round(pctB)` before display

#### Added — Live match: status text under batting team (MatchCard.tsx)
- `LiveSide` now accepts `status?: string` prop
- Status line rendered in cyan below the batting team's score (e.g. "CSK need 34 off 22 balls")
- Only shown for the batting team, not the fielding team

#### Added — MiniStandings in match Live tab for league matches (MatchView.tsx, MiniStandings.tsx)
- Compact standings card (Team / W / L / NRR / Pts) rendered in the Live tab when `match.competition.type === "league"`
- Each team row is a `<Link>` to `/schedule/{comp.id}/{team.code}`
- Playoff line indicator (top-4 teal bar) + "Tap team for their schedule" hint

#### Added — TABLE tab in match view (MatchView.tsx, MatchTabs.tsx, StandingsTab.tsx)
- `showTable = competition.type === "league" || "international"`
- When true, a fourth **Table** tab appears in the match tab bar
- `StandingsTab` renders full standings with position numbers, NRR, playoff line, eliminated teams
- `STANDINGS_MAP` currently maps `"ipl-2026"` → full IPL 2026 standings; other competitions show "coming soon"

## [1.0.11] 2026-07-02

### Team Data — accurate jersey colors + full league rosters

#### Fixed — National team jersey colors (mockData.ts)
- **AUS**: `#006A4E` (wrong green) → `#FFB81C` (Aussie Gold) — the most critical fix
- **ENG**: `#C8102E` (St George red) → `#1D244E` (England Navy) + `#00A0C6` cyan accent
- **BAN**: `#006A4E` (duplicate of old AUS) → `#1A6B3A` (Bangladesh Green)
- **ZIM**: `#006400` (dark green) → `#D4212D` (Zimbabwe Red, actual jersey)
- **NZ**: secondary updated to `#A8A9AD` silver (Black Caps brand)
- **WI**: maroon deepened to `#6E1436` + `#FFC726` gold (CWI official palette)
- **USA**: swapped — navy `#002868` now primary, red secondary (jersey is navy)
- All other national teams: minor shade accuracy improvements

#### Added — 7 new national teams
- UAE 🇦🇪 (red/white), Namibia 🇳🇦 (blue/gold), Papua New Guinea 🇵🇬 (black/red)
- Oman 🇴🇲 (maroon/white), Canada 🇨🇦 (red/white), Kenya 🇰🇪 (green/red), Uganda 🇺🇬 (black/yellow)

#### Added — Missing franchise teams (full rosters for every competition)
- **BBL**: Melbourne Renegades (RENE, red), Adelaide Strikers (STR, navy/gold) — now 8/8
- **The Hundred**: Northern Superchargers (NSC, yellow), Trent Rockets (TRR, red),
  Welsh Fire (WEF, maroon/gold), Birmingham Phoenix (BPH, maroon/gold) — now 8/8
- **SA20**: Pretoria Capitals (PREC, navy), Paarl Royals (PARR, pink), Durban's Super Giants (DURGD, teal) — now 6/6
- **CPL**: Jamaica Tallawahs (JAT, gold), St Kitts Patriots (SKP, green), St Lucia Kings (SLK, blue) — now 6/6
- **MLC**: Seattle Orcas (SEAO, teal), San Francisco Unicorns (SFU, orange), Washington Freedom (WASF, red) — now 6/6

#### Fixed — TypeScript build errors (Vercel was failing)
- `schedule/page.tsx`: escaped template literals `\`` → `` ` ``
- `CommentaryFeed.tsx`: innings type `1|2` → `1|2|3|4`
- `winProb.ts`: missing `totalBalls`/`totalBalls2` in `calculatePressureGauge`
- `page.tsx`: `UPCOMING_MATCHES` → `ALL_UPCOMING_MATCHES`

---

## [1.0.10] 2026-07-01

### Performance — faster animations, smarter re-renders

#### Removed — feGaussianBlur SVG filter from animated ball circles (BallGIF.tsx)
- `#glowB` (BowlerView) and `#glowO` (OverheadView) filters used `feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="3"`
- SVG filters are CPU-rasterized on every animation frame (60fps) — the single biggest GPU bottleneck
- Removed `filter="url(#glowB/O)"` from all animated circles; ball gradient fill remains fully visible

#### Removed — `animate attributeName="r"` from animated ball circles
- Changing the SVG `r` attribute per-frame forces geometry recalculation and full repaint
- Removed from pre-pitch ball, post-pitch ball (BowlerView), and overhead ball (OverheadView)
- Ball size is now fixed per phase rather than interpolated — visually indistinguishable

#### Added — React.memo on 7 heavy components
- `ScoreBar`, `MatchTabs`, `MiniInsightsBar`, `AIMetrics`, `MomentsStrip`, `CommentaryFeed`, `MiniWinProb`
- Components skip re-render when their props haven't changed shallowly
- `handleMomentSelect` in MatchView.tsx wrapped in `useCallback([allBalls.length])` so
  `MomentsStrip`'s `onSelect` prop is a stable reference between renders

#### Unchanged — Sticky header backdrop-blur
- `backdrop-blur` temporarily removed then restored; static sticky elements only re-composite
  on scroll — negligible compared to the 60fps SVG filter work that was the real bottleneck
- ScoreBar, MatchTabs, MiniInsightsBar, BottomNav frosted-glass look fully preserved

---

## [1.0.9] 2026-07-01

### Ball visualizer accuracy — perspective mapping + bounce arc

#### Fixed — Perspective-correct impact Y position (BallGIF.tsx — BowlerView)
- Previous formula: `impactY = PITCH_BOT_Y - pitchY * (PITCH_BOT_Y - PITCH_TOP_Y)` (linear)
- Linear is wrong for a perspective projection. The pitch trapezoid (220px wide at batter end,
  80px wide at bowler end) encodes a real perspective with width ratio 2.75.
- In a perspective view, equal 3D distances on the pitch map non-linearly to screen Y:
  the near half (batter end) takes up proportionally more visual space than the far half.
- New formula: `impactY = PITCH_BOT_Y - (wRatio × range × pitchY) / (1 + (wRatio-1) × pitchY)`
  where `wRatio = PITCH_BOT_W / PITCH_TOP_W = 220 / 80 = 2.75`
- Effect: good-length balls now appear in the upper third of the pitch (not the visual middle);
  short balls appear close to the bowler's crease; full deliveries barely change (near end
  where linear and perspective converge). Matches real TV broadcast pitch map expectations.

#### Fixed — Post-pitch bounce arc (BallGIF.tsx — BowlerView)
- Previous: `postPitchControl.y = (impactY + batterArrivalY) / 2` — control point on the
  straight line midpoint, producing zero upward arc. Ball appeared to slide along pitch.
- New: `postPitchControl.y = impactY - bounceH` where `bounceH = 10 + pitchY * 50`
- Control point sits above the impact point, creating a quadratic bezier that arcs upward
  after pitching then curves back down to the batter — physically accurate bounce shape
- Bounce height scales with delivery type: yorkers ≈ 10px, good-length ≈ 33px, bouncers ≈ 55px

---

## [1.0.8] 2026-07-01

### MiniWinProb — full redesign, both teams visible

#### Redesigned — MiniWinProb component (MiniWinProb.tsx)
- Previous design showed only the leading team's win% in a small chip — other team was hidden
- New design shows both teams' percentages side-by-side, both in `text-2xl font-bold`
- Leader is `text-text-primary`; trailing team is `text-text-dim` — clear hierarchy without hiding data
- SVG chart: gradient area fills below each team's line (30% opacity at line → 3% at bottom)
- Lines are 2.4px; ends have a dot with an outer glow ring in team colour
- Split colour bar at the bottom (same style as home page match cards)
- Chart height 72px; SVG gradient IDs namespaced (`mwp-fa`/`mwp-fb`) to prevent DOM conflicts
- `brighten()` helper normalises dark team colours (MI navy, KKR purple) so they're visible
  on the dark background — preserves hue, pushes brightest channel to 255

---

## [1.0.7] 2026-07-01

### UX polish — nav cleanup, team colours, scorecard orientation

#### Fixed — Back button removed from Schedule and Table headers (schedule/page.tsx, table/page.tsx)
- Schedule and Table are primary navigation destinations (reached via bottom tab bar)
- A ← back link on these pages implied a nav stack that doesn't exist — confusing to users
- Headers now show only the page title + subtitle; no back affordance

#### Fixed — GT team colour dot invisible in Table (lib/mockData.ts)
- GT's `primaryColor` was `#1B2133` — the same shade as the dark surface background
- Dot was rendering but completely invisible against the card background
- Changed to cobalt blue `#4285F4` — clearly distinct from MI navy (`#004BA0`),
  DC royal (`#17449B`), and LSG cyan (`#00A2D6`)

#### Added — Sticky innings header in Scorecard tab (Scorecard.tsx)
- InningsCard header (`Mumbai Indians · Innings 1 | 174/6`) is now `sticky top-[148px] z-20`
- Stays visible while scrolling through batting rows — user always knows which innings they're reading
- Removed `overflow-hidden` from outer card wrapper (was preventing sticky from working)
- Header gets `rounded-t-2xl` to maintain card aesthetics

---

## [1.0.6] 2026-07-01

### Bug fix + commentary colour refinement

#### Fixed — Whitish SVG wash on BallGIF in Safari (globals.css, MatchView.tsx)
- `perspective: 900px` was set as a permanent inline style on `<main>` in MatchView
- Safari promotes children of a `perspective` parent into separate GPU compositing layers
- SVG `fill="url(#id)"` gradient references break across compositing boundaries in Safari —
  fills fell back to transparent, letting the light card background bleed through as a white wash
- Fix: moved `perspective(900px)` inside each `@keyframes` transform so the 3D context
  only exists during the 220–300ms animation window, not permanently
- Removed `style={{ perspective: "900px" }}` from the `<main>` element

#### Changed — Commentary ball colours (lib/outcomeColors.ts)
- **Two (2)**: was mint green `#4ADE80` — now slate `#64748B`, same as dot and single
  (dots / singles / doubles all group visually as "low-impact" deliveries)
- **Three (3)**: was gold/yellow `#FBBF24` — now hot pink `#EC4899`
  (rare delivery, now unmistakably distinct)
- Singles and dots were already matching slate from v1.0.5; doubles now join them

---

## [1.0.5] 2026-07-01

### Commentary colours + nav on match page + book page-turn animation

#### Changed — Commentary ball colours (lib/outcomeColors.ts)
- **Six**: badge/tint changed from purple (`#A855F7`) → turquoise green (`#2DD4BF`)
- **Single**: was mint green — now uses the exact same colours as a dot ball (slate `#64748B`)
- **Wicket**: stays red (`#EF4444`) ✓

#### Fixed — Bottom nav missing on match page (BottomNav.tsx + MatchView.tsx)
- Removed the `/match/*` exclusion — BottomNav now renders on every page including match page
- On match page, no tab is highlighted (all dimmed) — still allows jumping to Home / Schedule / Table
- Added `pb-24` to MatchView so commentary feed doesn't get cut off behind the nav

#### Added — Book page-turn animation for tab transitions (globals.css + MatchView.tsx)
- New `goToTab()` function: tab header highlights new tab immediately, then animates content
- Exit phase (220ms, ease-in): content slides + rotates 28° in 3D — page folding away
- Enter phase (300ms, ease-out): new content slides in from opposite side — page unfolding
- Direction-aware: left swipe = forward, right swipe = backward
- Works identically for touch swipe and tab header tap
- `renderedTab` state separates what's highlighted (responds instantly) from what renders (animates)

---

## [1.0.4] 2026-07-01

### UX overhaul — immediate wins + medium effort

#### Added — Tap / press feedback (globals.css + MatchCard.tsx)
- `.tap-scale` CSS class: cards scale to 0.97 and darken on press (100ms ease)
- Applied to Live, Past, and Future match cards; next match link in empty state

#### Added — Improved back button (ScoreBar.tsx)
- Back arrow has a larger tap target, "Back" text label, and active press state

#### Added — Better empty state for Live carousel (LiveCarousel.tsx)
- When no matches are live, shows a card with next upcoming match
- Displays both team names with colours, countdown ("in 2d 14h"), match time and venue

#### Added — Loading skeleton on home boot (page.tsx + globals.css)
- `@keyframes shimmer-slide` + `.skeleton` class: animated left-to-right shimmer
- Home page shows shimmering placeholder cards for 350ms while content loads

#### Added — Pull-to-refresh on home page (page.tsx)
- Pull down from top shows spinning cyan indicator; only triggers at scroll position 0

#### Added — Swipe between tabs on match page (MatchView.tsx + MatchTabs.tsx)
- Swipe left → next tab (Live → Scorecard → Info); swipe right → previous tab
- Ignores mostly-vertical swipes so normal scroll still works

#### Added — Score event badge on Scorecard tab (MatchView.tsx + MatchTabs.tsx)
- Wicket → red pulsing dot on Scorecard tab; Six → purple pulsing dot
- Badge clears after 4 seconds or when user switches to Scorecard

#### Fixed — Infinite scroll broken by layout change (page.tsx + layout.tsx)
- Scroll listener now attaches to `document.getElementById("main-scroll")`

#### Fixed — Sticky headers offset (MatchView.tsx + schedule/page.tsx + table/page.tsx)
- `sm:top-4` caused 16px gap inside scroll container; all sticky headers changed to `top-0`

---

## [1.0.3] 2026-07-01

### Fix — Bottom nav visible on all pages

#### Problem
BottomNav used `position: fixed` inside a `phone-frame` div that has `overflow: clip` on desktop,
causing the nav to be clipped on Schedule and Table pages.

#### Fix
- BottomNav moved outside `phone-frame` entirely in `layout.tsx` — now a sibling, not a child
- `position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 50%; -translate-x-1/2; width: min(430px, 100vw)` — never clipped
- `phone-frame` reverted to simple `mx-auto bg-bg min-h-screen max-w-[430px]` container
- All pages get `pb-24` so content clears the fixed nav

---

## [1.0.2] 2026-06-30

### Scorecard highlights + Win-prob revert

#### Added — Scorecard per-innings highlighting (Scorecard.tsx)
- Highest scorer: name + runs in teal (`text-teal-400`) per innings
- Highest wicket-taker: name + wickets in red (`text-wicket`) per innings
- Highest strike rate (min 6 balls): SR cell in blue (`text-blue-400`) per innings
- Man of Match: name in gold (`text-yellow-400`) + "MOM" badge
- Man of Series: name in purple (`text-six`) + "MOS" badge
- MOM/MOS summary banners shown above innings cards when match is complete

#### Added — result fields in types + mock data (lib/types.ts, lib/mockData.ts)
- Added `manOfMatch?: string` and `manOfTournament?: string` to `result` object
- FEATURED_MATCH: `manOfMatch: "Andre Russell"`, `manOfTournament: "Virat Kohli"`

#### Reverted — Win probability back to two-crossing-lines (MiniWinProb.tsx, WinProbChart.tsx)
- Replaced single-area-chart redesign with original two-crossing-lines design
- Both team lines cross at 50% naturally as win probability shifts

---

## [1.0.1] 2026-06-30

### Build stability hotfix

#### Fixed — Truncated source files
- 6 files truncated on disk (AIMetrics.tsx, BallGIF.tsx, FilterBar.tsx, MatchCard.tsx,
  MomentsStrip.tsx, app/layout.tsx) — completed all missing tails

#### Fixed — Missing React imports (8 files)
- `React.CSSProperties` / `React.ReactNode` require explicit import under Next.js JSX transform
- Added React to: MatchCard, FilterBar, layout, page, DeliveryCard, InlineNote,
  InsightsPanel, LineupsCard, Scorecard, ViewSwitcher

#### Fixed — Null bytes in page.tsx
- Thousands of `\x00` null bytes stripped (TypeScript reported each as "Invalid character")

#### Fixed — Strict TypeScript null in match/[id]/page.tsx
- Added `match!` non-null assertion after `notFound()` call (safe — notFound never returns)

#### Fixed — MatchCard.tsx missing "use client"
- `fmtCountdown()` calls `Date.now()` at render time; directive added

---

## [1.0.0] 2026-06-30

### UI/UX overhaul — navigation, readability, hierarchy

#### Added — Bottom navigation bar (BottomNav.tsx + layout.tsx)
- Persistent bottom nav: Home / Schedule / Table; active tab cyan + underline indicator

#### Fixed — AI metric tiles (AIMetrics.tsx)
- Context sub-label, trend arrow (↑/↓), and delta line per tile

#### Fixed — Upcoming match cards (MatchCard.tsx)
- Visual bottom anchor bar: clock + cyan countdown + time + city

#### Fixed — Moments strip (MomentsStrip.tsx)
- Two-zone chip layout; Live chip with pulsing dot; 2-line clamped context

#### Fixed — Ball visualization info hierarchy (BallGIF.tsx)
- Delivery type large on left; outcome badge right; bowler→batsman sub-row

#### Fixed — Home filter chip team colour (FilterBar.tsx + page.tsx)
- Glowing team-colour dot in TEAM filter chip when active
